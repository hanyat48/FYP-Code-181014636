## FYP-Code-181014636

THis project aims to use OCT images provided by Dr Peter to detect tooth decay. This was achieved through several steps including denoising, masking, registering and reconstruction. Codes A, B and C run in matlab. Whereas, code D, mainscript, software and webapp are all run in python. The README.docx document provides a detailed runthrough of the requirements and the steps taken to run each code as well as testing them. 

To access the codes, clone the repository or download the files.
